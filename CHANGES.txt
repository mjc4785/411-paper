    I created an initialization function in the registers.h function that creates all the regesters as NULL. 

    - 2:35
        1) I think i remember you saying that the registers are simply int pointers so i reqrote them as such so we could initialize them to nullptr.

    I just added in the first opcode for addition
    I made a function called setFlags which changes the Flag register in the z80 according to the results and things done in arrithmetic 
    Still need to figure out how to actually implement everything in the actual operation execution (carry, half carry, and overflow)

    i tried to implement flags. i can explain better later if needed
